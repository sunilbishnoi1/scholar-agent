        You are a research assistant AI. Your task is to generate a list of relevant keywords
        and a list of research subtopics for a given research question and title.

        Research Question: "{research_question}"
        Title: "{title}"

        Please generate:
        1. A list of 8-12 diverse and specific keywords for searching academic databases.
        2. A list of 4-6 specific subtopics to structure the literature review.

        Provide the output as a single JSON object with two keys: "keywords" and "subtopics".
        Ensure the output is ONLY the JSON object, without any surrounding text or markdown.

        Example Output:
        {{
            "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"],
            "subtopics": ["Subtopic A", "Subtopic B", "Subtopic C"]
