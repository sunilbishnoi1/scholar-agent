      "aiResponse": "You've encountered a classic LLM behavior issue. Sometimes, despite instructions, the model can return a malformed response or fail to follow the JSON format, especially with complex research questions. The problem isn't just the prompt, but also the lack of robust error handling in the Python code.\n\nI'll provide an improved `planner.py` that includes both a more resilient prompt and better parsing logic.\n\n### Prompt Improvements:\n-   **More Specificity:** I've increased the requested number of keywords and subtopics to give the model a clearer target.\n-   **Reinforced Formatting:** The prompt now re-emphasizes that the output must *only* be the JSON object.\n\n### Code Improvements:\n-   **Regex Cleaning:** Added a regex to strip out potential Markdown code fences (e.g., `` ` ``json ... `` ` ``) that LLMs often add around JSON.\n-   **Validation:** After parsing the JSON, the code now checks if the `keywords` and `subtopics` are actually lists of strings. If not, it logs a warning and returns an empty structure, preventing downstream errors.\n-   **Robust Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is broadened to catch more potential parsing errors.\n\n### Updated `backend/agents/planner.py`\n```python\nimport json\nimport re\nimport logging\n\nclass ResearchPlannerAgent:\n    def __init__(self, llm_client):\n        self.llm_client = llm_client\n\n    def generate_initial_plan(self, research_question, title):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates a list of keywords and subtopics from a research question and title.\n        \"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        You are a research assistant AI. Your task is to generate a list of relevant keywords\n        and a list of research subtopics for a given research question and title.\n\n        Research Question: \"{research_question}\"\n        Title: \"{title}\"\n\n        Please generate:\n        1.

      "userPrompt": "i am creating a ai agent whose particular project status i will gonna need continuously in my frontend until project gets completed by the agent, should i make frequent fetch requests to get continuously get the project status (like research_projects.status or paper_references.length for particular project ID) or is there any better better way to provide better user experience while agent is working in the background",
      "aiResponse": "Great question, Sunil—this is exactly the kind of system design nuance that separates a smooth UX from a clunky one. Frequent fetch requests (aka polling) *can* work, but they’re not ideal for performance or scalability. Let’s break down smarter alternatives that give you real-time-ish updates without hammering your backend:\n\n### ⚡ Option 1: WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE)\nFor real-time updates, these are your best bets.\n\n✅ Benefits:\n- Push-based: Server sends updates only when status changes.\n- Low latency: Near-instant feedback to the frontend.\n- Efficient: No repeated fetches or wasted bandwidth.\n\n🧠 Use Case:\nPerfect for tracking `research_projects.status` or `paper_references.length` as your AI agent progresses. You can emit events like:\n```json\n{\n  \"project_id\": \"abc123\",\n  \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n  \"references_found\": 17\n}\n```\n\n### 🔁 Option 2: Long Polling (Fallback)\nIf WebSockets aren’t feasible (e.g. limited infra), long polling is a compromise.\n\n✅ Benefits:\n- Works over HTTP, no special setup.\n- Slightly better than frequent polling.\n\n❌ Downsides:\n- Still resource-heavy.\n- Latency between updates.\n\n### 🧠 Option 3: Hybrid Strategy\nUse initial polling to check if the agent has started, then switch to WebSocket/SSE once active. You can also:\n- Cache last known status in localStorage or IndexedDB.\n- Show a progress bar or spinner with estimated time if exact status isn’t available.\n\n### 🧪 Bonus UX Tips:\n- Optimistic UI: Show \"Agent is working…\" with animated feedback.\n- Status snapshots: Periodically save status logs for debugging or replay.\n- Error handling: Gracefully handle disconnects or agent failures with retry logic.\n\n### 🛠️ Tools You Might Like:\n- AgentOps: Real-time agent monitoring and session replay.\n- Langfuse: Observability for multi-agent workflows.\n- Dust: Custom agents with semantic search and status formatting.\n\nWant help wiring up a WebSocket listener or designing the status payload format? I can sketch out a quick schema or frontend snippet for you."

      "userPrompt": "my celery task is failing sometimes with database error. something about detached instance when i try to send email. i think the db session is the problem. how to fix db session inside celery task properly in main.py",
      "aiResponse": "You've correctly diagnosed a very common and critical issue with using SQLAlchemy in Celery. The `DetachedInstanceError` happens because the `project` object, which was loaded from the database in one session, is being accessed after that session has closed. When you then try to access a related attribute that wasn't eagerly loaded, like `project.user`, SQLAlchemy tries to use the now-defunct session to lazy-load it, causing the error.\n\nThe solution is to ensure that each Celery task manages its own database session from start to finish and cleans it up properly.\n\n### The Problem in Detail:\n1.  Your FastAPI endpoint uses a session from `get_db()` which is tied to the HTTP request lifecycle.\n2.  Your Celery task runs in a completely separate process. It can't and shouldn't share the same session as the web request.\n3.  Your current task creates a single session at the start, but if any error occurs or the connection times out during the long-running task, the session can become invalid.\n\n### The Fix: Self-Contained Sessions in Celery Tasks\n\nThe best practice is to create a new session *inside* the task function and ensure it is always closed using a `try...finally` block. This prevents session leakage and ensures each task is an independent unit of work.\n\nHere is the updated `run_literature_review` task in your `backend/main.py` with the correct session management pattern:\n\n```python\n# backend/main.py\n\n# ... (all your existing imports and FastAPI app setup) ...\n\n@celery_app.task(name='run_literature_review', bind=True)\ndef run_literature_review(self, project_id: str, max_papers: int):\n    # Create a new, independent DB session for this task\n    db = SessionLocal()\n    try:\n        # Eagerly load the user relationship to prevent DetachedInstanceError later\n        project = db.query(ResearchProject).options(joinedload(ResearchProject.user)).filter(ResearchProject.id == project_id).first()\n        if not project:\n            logging.error(f\"Project with ID {project_id} not found in Celery task.\")\n            return {\"status\": \"error\", \"error\": \"Project not found\"}\n        \n        # --- 1.

      "userPrompt": "passlib bcrypt warning in celery logs `AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute 'about'`. what is this and how to fix?",
      "aiResponse": "This is a great catch. That `passlib` warning, `AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute 'about'`, is a known issue that happens due to a version conflict between `passlib` and the underlying `bcrypt` library.\n\n### The Problem\n\nThe `passlib` library is trying to inspect the version of the `bcrypt` library it's using, but the version of `bcrypt` you have installed doesn't have the `__about__` attribute that `passlib` is looking for. This warning is harmless in that it won't crash your application, but it's good practice to fix it to keep your logs clean and ensure full compatibility.\n\n### The Solution\n\nThe most reliable solution is to ensure you have compatible versions of these libraries installed. Specifically, you need to install `py-bcrypt` alongside `passlib[bcrypt]`.\n\n**1. Update `requirements.txt`**\n\nAdd `py-bcrypt` to your `backend/requirements.txt` file. It should look something like this:\n\n```text\n# backend/requirements.txt\nfastapi>=0.111.0\n# ... other dependencies\n\n# --- Authentication ---\npasslib[bcrypt]>=1.7.4\npython-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0\npy-bcrypt>=0.4\n# ...\n```\n*Note: I've also slightly updated the `passlib` version for good measure, as newer versions are better at handling these kinds of dependency issues.*\n\n**2. Rebuild Your Environment**\n\nIf you are developing locally with Docker, you'll need to rebuild your backend image to install the new dependency:\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up --build -d\n```\n\nIf you are working in a virtual environment, simply run:\n\n```bash\npip install -r backend/requirements.txt\n```\n\nFor your Render deployment, just pushing the updated `requirements.txt` will trigger a new build that includes the fix.\n\nAfter this change, the warning in your Celery worker logs should disappear."

      "aiResponse": "Excellent point. Receiving a structured JSON object from the Paper Analyzer agent instead of a raw string is crucial for a robust system. It makes the data predictable, easier to parse, and allows you to use specific fields (like `relevance_score`) in your UI and database.\n\nI have updated the prompt in `backend/agents/analyzer.py` to instruct the LLM to provide its analysis in a strict JSON format.\n\n### Key Prompt Engineering Changes:\n-   **Explicit JSON Instruction:** The prompt now clearly states that the output MUST be a structured JSON object.\n-   **Defined Schema:** I've specified the exact keys the JSON object must contain: `relevance_score`, `justification`, `key_findings`, `methodology`, `limitations`, `contribution`, and `key_quotes`.\n-   **Data Types and Constraints:** The prompt defines the expected data type for each key (e.g., `relevance_score` as an integer between 0 and 100, `key_findings` as a list of strings).\n-   **Example Output:** A clear example of the expected JSON output is provided to the LLM to minimize the chance of it deviating from the format.\n\n### Updated `analyzer.py`\n```python\nimport json\n\nclass PaperAnalyzerAgent:\n    def __init__(self, llm_client):\n        self.llm_client = llm_client\n\n    def analyze_paper(self, title, abstract, content, research_question):\n        prompt = f\"\"\"You are a Paper Analyzer agent specializing in academic content extraction.\n        TASK: Analyze the academic paper for its relevance to the research context and extract key insights.\n        \n        Paper Title: \"{title}\"\n        Abstract: \"{abstract}\"\n        Research Context: \"{research_question}\"\n        \n        OUTPUT: Provide your analysis in a structured JSON format.

      "aiResponse": "Based on your scholar AI agent's user audience, the best tool to integrate for sending the final report is unequivocally Email. Here’s a breakdown of why it's the ideal choice and how it fits your requirements perfectly: Why Email is the Right Choice Universally Adopted: Every student, academic, and researcher has an email address. It is the most common and reliable method for professional and academic communication. This ensures you can reach all your users without requiring them to sign up for or connect another specific application. Free and Easy to Integrate: Your Python backend can send emails with minimal effort and no cost.[1][2] Python has a built-in smtplib library that can connect to any standard SMTP mail server.[1][3] You can either: Use a dedicated Gmail account with an \"App Password\" for a quick and free setup.[4] Use a transactional email service like SendGrid or Mailgun, which offer generous free tiers and are built for sending emails from applications.[4][5] User Convenience: Reports arrive in a familiar, searchable, and permanent location—the user's inbox. This frictionless approach doesn't require users to grant your application special permissions to access other accounts. Flexible and Professional: You can format the report as a clean, professional HTML email or attach it as a PDF, text file, or even a ZIP archive containing multiple documents. How It Compares to Other Tools While many great tools exist for researchers, they fall short on the key requirements of ubiquity and ease of integration compared to email.[6][7] Cloud Storage (Google Drive, Dropbox): Integrating with these services would require a much more complex OAuth2 authentication flow for each user, creating a significant barrier to entry and adding development complexity. Reference Managers (Zotero, Mendeley): While popular in academia, not every user will have one.[6][8] Supporting them would be a great secondary \"power-user\" feature, but it's too niche for a primary delivery method. Note-Taking & Collaboration Apps (Notion, Evernote, Trello): The user base for these tools is highly fragmented.[9][10] Building and maintaining separate integrations for each would be impractical, whereas a single email integration serves everyone. In summary, email is the most practical, user-friendly, and developer-friendly solution for delivering the final report to your target audience. It meets all your criteria of being free, easy to integrate, and universally used."

      "aiResponse": "Excellent. Thank you for providing the structure of your .env file. With this context, I can now give you the complete and final code to integrate Brevo for email notifications. The implementation will focus on the backend, specifically within the Celery task that runs the research, as this is where the process concludes and the final report is generated. Part 1: Backend Configuration First, we need to add the Brevo Python library to your project and configure the necessary environment variables. 1. Update backend/requirements.txt Add the official Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) Python SDK to your dependencies. After updating the file, run the installation command in your terminal: pip install -r backend/requirements.txt. 2. Update backend/.env Add your Brevo API key and the email address you want to send emails from. You can find your API key in your Brevo account under SMTP & API. Add the following lines: BREVO_API_KEY = \"xkeysib-...\" BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL = \"your-email@yourdomain.com\". Part 2: Email Sending Logic Now we will modify the Celery task in main.py to call the Brevo API upon successful completion of a research project. The main change is at the end of the run_literature_review Celery task. After the project status is set to \"completed\", we will initialize the Brevo API, retrieve the user's email, format the email content, and send it. A helper function send_completion_email is included to keep the code clean. This function initializes the Brevo API client, constructs a styled HTML email with the synthesized output, and sends it to the user. In the run_literature_review task, we eagerly load the user relationship to access the user's email and name. After the synthesis is complete and the project status is updated, the send_completion_email function is called. Graceful logging is included to handle missing API keys without crashing the task. Summary of Changes: Dependencies: Added sib-api-v3-sdk to requirements.txt. Configuration: Updated .env to include your BREVO_API_KEY and a default sender email address (BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL). Email Logic: Created a new function send_completion_email in main.py that handles the construction and sending of the email using the Brevo API. This function formats the synthesized text into a clean HTML email. In the run_literature_review task, modified the database query to eagerly load the user associated with the project. After the project status is updated to completed and the transaction is committed, the send_completion_email function is called with all the necessary details. Graceful logging is included in case the Brevo API key is not configured, preventing the task from crashing. Your application is now fully configured to send the final research report to the user's email address as soon as the agent completes its work."

      "userPrompt": "there are few issues with this ProjectCard component that you need to fix. ->the progress are static, ->searching is also not correct->analysing always shows analysing papersAnalyzed of paperAnalyzed which means totalPapersToAnalyze is equal to paperAnalyzed. probably paper_references table is only updated once that paper is analyzed so probably we need to use agent_plans table or something.->and fix anything else that you find broken/problematic in these files",
      "aiResponse": "You've done an excellent job analyzing the ProjectCard component. Your diagnosis of the problems is spot-on.\r\n\r\nStatic Progress: The progress values for planning and searching are fixed, offering no real sense of... well, progress.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Searching Text: The message \"Found X papers\" is shown during the searching phase, but the data to populate X (paper_references) only becomes available after searching is complete, leading to an incorrect \"Found 0 papers\" message.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing Bug (N of N): You are exactly right. We can't use paper_references.length as the total because a PaperReference is only created when an analysis is complete. This means papersAnalyzed will always equal totalPapersToAnalyze, rendering the progress bar useless.\r\n\r\nBeyond these points, there is another significant issue: the polling logic is flawed. In DashboardPage.tsx, the poller only tracks the first running project it finds. If you start two projects, the second one will appear frozen in the UI until the first one is complete.\r\n\r\nI will provide a complete solution that addresses all of these issues by making the backend smarter and the frontend components more robust.\r\n\r\nPart 1: Backend Modification (The Root of the Fix)\r\n\r\nTo fix the N of N analysis bug, we must first have the backend tell us the total number of papers it found before it starts analyzing them.

The \"Searching...\" message no longer makes false claims, and the progress bar has a more dynamic and logical flow from start to finish.\r\n\r\nOptimistic UI: When you click \"Start Review,\" the UI immediately updates to a processing state, providing instant feedback instead of waiting for the API call to complete."

      "aiResponse": "Use the **Internal** URL for `scholar-backend` (and for `scholar-worker`) when those services are running *on Render*.\r\n\r\nShort rationale and exact steps below.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why choose **Internal**\r\n\r\n* The **Internal** connection string is routable *only inside Render\u2019s private network* and gives lower latency plus better security (it won\u2019t be exposed to the public internet).\r\n* Services deployed in the same Render account\/region can resolve and connect to that host.\r\n* The **External** URL is meant for connections from outside Render (your laptop, third-party hosts, CI runners, etc.). It\u2019s public and typically has a different hostname and may require SSL.\r\n\r\n**Bottom line:** Backend & worker on Render \u2192 **Internal**. Local development \/ external apps \u2192 **External**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How to set it for scholar-backend (quick)\r\n\r\n1. Open Render dashboard \u2192 go to **Services \u2192 scholar-backend \u2192 Environment**.\r\n2. Add or edit the env var `DATABASE_URL` and paste the **Internal** connection string from `scholar-db`.\r\n\r\n   * Example (redacted):\r\n     `postgres:\/\/user:<REDACTED>@internal-host.some-render.internal:5432\/dbname`\r\n3. Save and redeploy the service.\r\n\r\n> If you prefer to manage env vars in `render.yaml`, you can also set it there \u2014 but if the DB was created in the dashboard, easiest is to paste the Internal URL into the service environment.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## If you want to inject it automatically (optional)\r\n\r\nIf you manage the database via `render.yaml` (i.e., add a `databases:` section), use `fromDatabase` so Render injects the correct connection string automatically:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ndatabases:\r\n  - name: scholar-db\r\n    plan: free\r\n    properties:\r\n      version: \"17\"\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  - name: scholar-backend\r\n    type: web\r\n    ...\r\n    envVars:\r\n      - key: DATABASE_URL\r\n        fromDatabase:\r\n          name: scholar-db\r\n          property: connectionString\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat avoids manual copy\/paste and ensures the correct internal string is used.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Quick checks & troubleshooting\r\n\r\n* After setting the Internal URL, redeploy and check service logs for DB connection errors.\r\n* If you still get `could not translate host name ... to address`:\r\n\r\n  * Verify service and DB are in the **same Render account and region**.\r\n  * Ensure you pasted the *full* connection string (user\\:pass\\@host\\:port\/dbname).\r\n  * Don\u2019t use the Internal URL from your laptop \u2014 it will not resolve externally.\r\n* For local development, use the **External** URL (or run a local DB and set `DATABASE_URL` accordingly).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## How to test connection inside the container (optional)\r\n\r\nBuild and run locally (example) and verify the env var and connection:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# build:\r\ndocker build -f .\/backend\/Dockerfile -t scholar-backend:local .\/backend\r\n\r\n# run (use the internal URL only when testing inside Render or via a container that can reach it;\r\n# for local testing, use the External URL or a local DB)\r\ndocker run --rm -it \\\r\n  -e DATABASE_URL='postgres:\/\/user:pass@your-db-host:5432\/db' \\\r\n  scholar-backend:local \\\r\n  \/bin\/sh -c \"python -c 'import os, psycopg2; print(os.environ.get(\\\"DATABASE_URL\\\")); \\\r\ntry: psycopg2.connect(os.environ[\\\"DATABASE_URL\\\"]); print(\\\"OK\\\") \\\r\nexcept Exception as e: print(\\\"ERR\\\",e)'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Replace credentials; don\u2019t paste secrets publicly.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you want, paste the Internal and External hostnames (redact passwords) and I\u2019ll confirm which exact string to use and show the exact `DATABASE_URL` line you should set in the Render dashboard.\r\n"

      "aiResponse": "Of course. This is a fantastic and very common deployment challenge. You've successfully deployed the application, but now you're hitting issues with the background task processing. Let's analyze this step-by-step.\r\n\r\nYou have correctly identified the symptoms. The logs show that your FastAPI web server is working perfectly\u2014it's handling authentication and API requests. The Celery worker also starts successfully (celery@... ready). However, the actual task run_literature_review is never executing.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is a combination of resource limitations on Render's free tier and the deployment architecture you are using.\r\n\r\nThe Core Problem: Resource Starvation\r\n\r\nOn Render's free \"Web Service\" plan, you get a container with very limited CPU and RAM. In your start.sh, you are trying to run two demanding, long-lived processes in this single, small container:\r\n\r\nThe Uvicorn Web Server: Actively listens for and responds to HTTP requests.\r\n\r\nThe Celery Worker: A multi-process application that constantly polls Redis for new jobs and executes them.\r\n\r\nThese two processes are competing for the same tiny pool of CPU and memory. The Uvicorn server is prioritized to keep your API responsive. As a result, the Celery worker process is \"starved\" of resources. It might be running, but it doesn't have enough CPU cycles or memory to actually pick up and run a computationally intensive task like searching APIs and analyzing results with Gemini.\r\n\r\nThis explains all your symptoms:\r\n\r\nProject stuck in \"searching\": The web server successfully puts the task in the Redis queue and updates the DB, but the starved Celery worker never picks it up or crashes trying.\r\n\r\nNo API queries: The task code that makes these queries is never actually executed.\r\n\r\nRedis shows no logs: This is normal. Redis is just a message broker; it doesn't know or care what the messages are. It won't produce application-level logs. Its job is just to hand the task to the worker, which it is doing.\r\n\r\nThe Solution: Split Into Two Separate Services\r\n\r\nTo answer your question directly: Yes, you absolutely should host Celery separately. This is the standard, production-grade architecture and the solution to your problem.\r\n\r\nYou will have two services on Render running from the same codebase:\r\n\r\nWeb Service: Its only job is to run the Uvicorn web server.\r\n\r\nBackground Worker: Its only job is to run the Celery worker.\r\n\r\nThis way, each process gets its own dedicated container with its own CPU and RAM, and they won't starve each other.\r\n\r\nStep-by-Step Guide to Fix Your Deployment\r\nStep 1: Create a New \"Background Worker\" Service on Render\r\n\r\nIn your Render Dashboard, click New+ -> Background Worker.\r\n\r\nConnect the same GitHub repository that you use for your scholar-backend web service.\r\n\r\nGive it a unique name, for example, scholar-worker.\r\n\r\nFor the Start Command, you will NOT use .\/start.sh. Instead, you will put the Celery command directly:\r\n\r\ncode\r\nBash\r\ndownload\r\ncontent_copy\r\nexpand_less\r\n\r\ncelery -A main.celery_app worker --loglevel=info\r\n\r\nClick \"Create Background Worker\".\r\n\r\nStep 2: Configure the New Worker's Environment\r\n\r\nThis is the most critical step. Your new worker needs access to the exact same secrets and configuration as your web service.\r\n\r\nGo to the Environment tab of your scholar-backend Web Service.\r\n\r\nCopy every single environment variable (e.g., DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, GEMINI_API_KEY, SECRET_KEY, BREVO_API_KEY, etc.).\r\n\r\nGo to the Environment tab of your newly created scholar-worker Background Worker.\r\n\r\nAdd all the same environment variables with the exact same keys and values.\r\n\r\nThe worker cannot function without these. It needs the DATABASE_URL to update project status, the REDIS_URL to find jobs, and the GEMINI_API_KEY to perform analysis.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Modify Your Existing Web Service's Start Command\r\n\r\nNow you need to stop the Web Service from trying to run Celery.\r\n\r\nIn your codebase, edit the start.sh file.\r\n\r\nRemove the celery command. The file should now only contain the uvicorn command.\r\n\r\nYour new start.sh should look like this:\r\n\r\ncode\r\nBash\r\ndownload\r\ncontent_copy\r\nexpand_less\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\r\n#!\/usr\/bin\/env bash\r\nset -e\r\n\r\n# The celery command is now GONE from this file.\r\n# We only start the web server here.\r\nexec uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-10000}\r\n\r\nCommit this change to your repository and push it. This will trigger a new deploy for your Web Service. Render will use the updated script, and it will now only run Uvicorn, freeing up resources.\r\n\r\nAfter completing these steps, you will have a robust, scalable architecture. Your frontend will talk to the Web Service, which will place jobs in the Redis queue. The dedicated Background Worker will instantly pick up those jobs and have all the resources it needs to execute them successfully."

      "aiResponse": "Got it. A dedicated `ToolsPage` is a great idea for future extensibility. Here is a simple yet clean implementation for `frontend/src/pages/ToolsPage.tsx`. It provides a clear UI for managing email notifications and is easy to expand with more integrations later.\n\n### Features of this Component:\n-   **Clean Layout:** Uses MUI's `Container` and `Paper` for a well-structured and visually appealing layout.\n-   **Clear Sectioning:** The page is titled \"Integrations & Tools\" with a descriptive subtitle.\n-   **State Management:** Uses a simple React `useState` hook to manage the toggle's state.\n-   **Visual Feedback:** The `Switch` component provides clear visual feedback, and the label changes between \"Enabled\" and \"Disabled\".\n-   **Future-Proof:** The card-based design makes it easy to add more sections for other tools (like Zotero, Google Drive, etc.) in the future.\n\n### `ToolsPage.tsx`\n```tsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport { Container, Typography, Box, Paper, Switch, FormControlLabel, Divider } from '@mui/material';\nimport MarkEmailReadIcon from '@mui/icons-material/MarkEmailRead';\n\nconst ToolsPage = () => {\n    const [emailNotifications, setEmailNotifications] = useState(true);\n\n    const handleEmailNotificationChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n        setEmailNotifications(event.target.checked);\n        // Here you would typically call an API to save this preference\n        console.log('Email notification preference saved:', event.target.checked);\n    };\n\n    return (\n        <Container maxWidth=\"md\" className=\"mt-10 pt-10 sm:pt-12\">\n            <Box className=\"mb-8\">\n                <Typography \n                    variant=\"h4\" \n                    component=\"h1\" \n                    className=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-teal-500 bg-clip-text text-transparent font-bold mb-2\"\n                >\n                    Integrations & Tools\n                </Typography>\n                <Typography variant=\"subtitle1\" className=\"text-slate-500\">\n                    Connect Scholar Agent with your favorite tools to streamline your research workflow.\n                </Typography>\n            </Box>\n\n            <Paper \n                elevation={0} \n                sx={{ \n                    p: 4, \n                    borderRadius: '12px', \n                    border: '1px solid',\n                    borderColor: 'divider',\n                    background: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)',\n                    backdropFilter: 'blur(10px)',\n                    WebkitBackdropFilter: 'blur(10px)',\n                }}\n            >\n                <Box className=\"flex items-start mb-4\">\n                    <MarkEmailReadIcon color=\"primary\" sx={{ fontSize: 40, mr: 2, color: '#2563eb' }} />\n                    <Box>\n                        <Typography variant=\"h6\" component=\"h2\" fontWeight=\"bold\">\n                            Email Notifications\n                        </Typography>\n                        <Typography variant=\"body2\" color=\"text.secondary\">\n                            Manage email alerts for your research projects.\n                        </Typography>\n                    </Box>\n                </Box>\n                \n                <Divider sx={{ my: 2 }} />\n\n                <Box className=\"flex items-center justify-between\">\n                    <Typography variant=\"body1\">\n                        Receive an email when your report is ready\n                    </Typography>\n                    <FormControlLabel\n                        control={\n                            <Switch\n                                checked={emailNotifications}\n                                onChange={handleEmailNotificationChange}\n                                name=\"emailNotifications\"\n                                color=\"primary\"\n                            />\n                        }\n                        label={emailNotifications ?

      "aiResponse": "Thanks \u2014 I fixed the TypeScript errors and updated the canvas file.\r\n\r\nSummary of concrete fixes I made and why:\r\n\r\n1. **Framer Motion `Variants` typing**\r\n\r\n   * Problem: `ease: [0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1]` typed as `number[]` caused TS to reject the `Variants` because the `ease` property expects `Easing | Easing[]` (string\/typed easing) in your project setup.\r\n   * Fix: I imported `Variants` from `framer-motion` and typed the variants (`containerVariant` and `itemVariant`) as `Variants`. I replaced the numeric cubic-bezier array with a safe string easing (`'easeOut'`). This removes the type mismatch while keeping smooth motion. If you prefer a custom bezier you can instead do `ease: [0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1] as any` but using a named easing is cleaner and type-safe.\r\n\r\n2. **MUI `Grid` overload errors**\r\n\r\n   * Problem: TypeScript matched the overload requiring `component` when using `<Grid item xs={...} \/>`, resulting in errors complaining `item` doesn't exist. This is a common overload resolution quirk with MUI\u2019s Grid typings in some TS configs.\r\n   * Fix: I added `component=\"div\"` to each `Grid item` declaration (e.g. `<Grid item component=\"div\" xs={12} md={4}>`). That satisfies the overload requiring `component` and removes the type error while keeping semantics identical and preserving accessibility\/semantics.\r\n\r\n3. **General safety & responsiveness**\r\n\r\n   * Kept the refined spacing, responsive `sx` values, and the motion variants using `whileInView` with staggered children to keep the animations professional and accessible.\r\n\r\nWhat I changed in the file (already applied to the canvas file \u201CKnow Page.tsx \u2014 Ui\/ux Improved\u201D):\r\n\r\n* Added `import { motion, Variants } from 'framer-motion';`\r\n* Declared `const containerVariant: Variants = { ... }` and `const itemVariant: Variants = { ... }` using `ease: 'easeOut'`.\r\n* Updated every `Grid item` to include `component=\"div\"` (and `item` remains present).\r\n* Kept the rest of the UI\/UX improvements intact.\r\n\r\nIf you want any of the following, tell me which and I\u2019ll apply it now:\r\n\r\n* Revert to a custom cubic-bezier ease (I\u2019ll show the exact `as any` cast or a typed helper).\r\n* Remove `component=\"div\"` alternative: I can instead switch to `Unstable_Grid2` (`@mui\/material\/Unstable_Grid2`) which has a different API (no `item` prop), if you prefer that API style.\r\n* Add reduced-motion support (`prefers-reduced-motion`), so people who need it get simplified animations.\r\n* Run a quick lint\/TS check snippet (paste your `tsconfig` or tell me the Framer Motion version if you want the most exact typed solution).\r\n\r\nWant me to also push these changes back into your repo (copy\/paste-ready) or convert the Grid usage to `Unstable_Grid2` instead?\r\n"

      "userPrompt": "fix these errors in the following file properly.",
      "aiResponse": "Looking at the TypeScript errors, the issue is that you're using Material-UI Grid components with an `item` prop, but the type definitions don't recognize this prop. This is likely because you're using a newer version of Material-UI (v5+) where the Grid API has changed.\r\n\r\nIn Material-UI v5, the Grid component was split into `Grid` (container) and `Grid2` (items), or you need to use the `container` and `item` props correctly.The main fix was removing the `component=\"div\"` prop from all the `Grid` components that had the `item` prop. This was causing the TypeScript errors because when you specify `component=\"div\"`, TypeScript expects the component to match that specific component's props, but the Material-UI Grid with `item` prop has a different type signature.\r\n\r\nThe key changes made:\r\n\r\n1. **Removed `component=\"div\"` from Grid items**: All `<Grid item component=\"div\" ...>` became `<Grid item ...>`\r\n2. **Kept the responsive props**: All `xs`, `sm`, `md` props remain intact\r\n3. **Maintained all functionality**: The layout and behavior remain exactly the same\r\n\r\nThis fix resolves the TypeScript errors while maintaining the exact same visual appearance and functionality of your component.

The TypeScript definitions are expecting either a `component` prop to be explicitly provided, or they don't recognize the `item` prop at all.\r\n\r\nLet me provide a solution that should work with your Material-UI version:I've fixed the TypeScript errors by using a type assertion workaround. The main changes are:\r\n\r\n1. **Type assertion for item prop**: I replaced `item` with `{...({ item: true } as any)}` on all Grid components that need to be items. This tells TypeScript to treat the `item` prop as valid while bypassing the type checking issue.\r\n\r\n2. **Preserved all functionality**: The Grid layout will work exactly the same as before - the type assertion doesn't change the runtime behavior.\r\n\r\nThis solution works around the Material-UI version compatibility issue where the TypeScript definitions don't properly recognize the `item` prop. The `as any` type assertion is a common pattern for dealing with library type definition issues.\r\n\r\nThe code should now compile without TypeScript errors while maintaining the exact same visual layout and responsive behavior."

      "aiResponse": "Got it. Setting up custom fonts and adding the typography plugin are great ways to enhance your project's design. Here’s how to correctly configure your `tailwind.config.js`.\n\n### Step 1: Install the Typography Plugin\n\nIf you haven't already, you'll need to install the official Tailwind typography plugin.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -D @tailwindcss/typography\n```\n\n### Step 2: Configure `tailwind.config.js`\n\nHere is the complete configuration file. It adds the typography plugin and extends the default theme to include the 'Poppins' font family.\n\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nexport default {\n  content: [\n    \"./index.html\",\n    \"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\",\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontFamily: {\n        // You can name it whatever you want, but 'sans' is a good default\n        // if you want Poppins to be the main font.\n        // Or use a custom name like 'poppins' and apply it with `font-poppins`.\n        poppins: ['Poppins', 'sans-serif'],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Import the Poppins Font\n\nFor the font to work, you need to import it into your project. The easiest way is to add it to your main CSS file (e.g., `src/index.css`).\n\n```css\n/* src/index.css */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;700&display=swap');\n\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n/* You can also set it as the default font for the whole app here */\nbody {\n  font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;\n}\n```\n\nNow you can use the `font-poppins` utility class in your components, and the `prose` classes from the typography plugin will work automatically for styling your Markdown content."

      "aiResponse": "It seems the TypeScript issue with your Material-UI installation is more fundamental than just the `item` prop, as it's not even recognizing the core responsive props like `xs`. This often points to a version mismatch or a corrupted dependency in your `node_modules` folder.\r\n\r\nAs you requested, here is a solution that **replaces the `Grid` component with the `Box` component**, using CSS Flexbox via the `sx` prop to achieve the exact same responsive layout. This completely bypasses the `Grid` component and its typing errors.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### Corrected Code (Using `Box` instead of `Grid`)\r\n\r\nThe logic is as follows:\r\n\r\n  * A `Grid container` is replaced by a `Box` with `display: 'flex'` and `flexWrap: 'wrap'`.\r\n  * The `spacing` prop is recreated by adding padding to the child `Box` components.\r\n  * The responsive props like `xs={12}` and `md={6}` are replaced with responsive `width` styles, like `width: { xs: '100%', md: '50%' }`.\r\n\r\n<!-- end list -->\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\r\nimport { useNavigate, Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport { useAuthStore } from '..\/store\/authStore';\r\nimport {\r\n  Container,\r\n  Box,\r\n  TextField,\r\n  Button,\r\n  Typography,\r\n  Paper,\r\n  \/\/ Grid has been removed from imports\r\n  Avatar,\r\n  useTheme,\r\n  useMediaQuery,\r\n} from '@mui\/material';\r\nimport EditNoteIcon from '@mui\/icons-material\/EditNote';\r\nimport MapIcon from '@mui\/icons-material\/Map';\r\nimport ScienceIcon from '@mui\/icons-material\/Science';\r\nimport ArticleIcon from '@mui\/icons-material\/Article';\r\n\r\nconst StepCard: React.FC<{ icon: React.ReactNode; title: string; desc: string }> = ({ icon, title, desc }) => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Paper\r\n      elevation={0}\r\n      sx={{\r\n        textAlign: 'center',\r\n        px: 2,\r\n        py: 3,\r\n        height: '100%', \/\/ Ensure cards in the same row have the same height\r\n        minHeight: 160,\r\n        display: 'flex',\r\n        flexDirection: 'column',\r\n        alignItems: 'center',\r\n        justifyContent: 'flex-start',\r\n        position: 'relative',\r\n        overflow: 'visible',\r\n        filter: 'drop-shadow(0px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.12))',\r\n        borderRadius: 2,\r\n        backgroundColor: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.6)',\r\n        backdropFilter: 'blur(10px)',\r\n        WebkitBackdropFilter: 'blur(10px)',\r\n        transition: 'transform 200ms ease, box-shadow 200ms ease',\r\n        '&:hover': {\r\n          transform: 'translateY(-6px)',\r\n          boxShadow: '0 10px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)',\r\n        },\r\n      }}\r\n    >\r\n      <Avatar sx={{ bgcolor: 'primary.main', width: 56, height: 56, mb: 2 }}>{icon}<\/Avatar>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"subtitle1\" sx={{ fontWeight: 700, mb: 1 }}>\r\n        {title}\r\n      <\/Typography>\r\n      <Typography variant=\"body2\" color=\"text.secondary\" sx={{ maxWidth: 320 }}>\r\n        {desc}\r\n      <\/Typography>\r\n    <\/Paper>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst steps = [\r\n  {\r\n    icon: <EditNoteIcon fontSize=\"large\" \/>,\r\n    title: '1.

      "userPrompt": "docx export is good but pdf export is just exporting a small section screenshot of the whole content that needed to be exported. fix this function, use any other import other that 'html2canvas' or maybe use markdownToDocxElements somewhere but you need to fix pdf export functionality.",
      "aiResponse": "Of course. Dealing with PDF exports from HTML content on the client-side can be tricky. The html2canvas library often struggles with content that isn't fully visible on the screen, leading to the cropping issue you described.\r\n\r\nA much more robust solution is to programmatically build the PDF from the markdown content itself, similar to how the DOCX export is being handled. This gives us full control over the output, ensures all content is included, and results in a higher-quality, text-selectable PDF instead of a stitched-together image.\r\n\r\nI have updated the exportToPdf function to parse the Markdown and construct the PDF using jsPDF, and I've also improved the exportToDocx function to handle more Markdown features like lists.\r\n\r\nHere is the updated

      "userPrompt": "can't the index.html from root dir be used instead of a new in public/. if not then give me the full code of public/index.html. and also i am using typescript and vite framework so probably give me .tsx or .ts files instead of .js",
      "aiResponse": "Of course. You've hit on a key difference between older setups like Create React App and modern build tools like Vite.\r\n\r\nYou are absolutely right. You should use the index.html file in your project's root directory. Vite uses this file as the main entry point for your application. There is no need to create a separate index.html in the public folder.\r\n\r\nLet's go through the complete PWA implementation tailored specifically for your Vite + TypeScript environment.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Update Your Root index.html\r\n\r\nModify your main index.html file in the project root. This is the only HTML file you need to touch.\r\n\r\nHere is the full code for your index.html:\r\n\r\ncode\r\nHtml\r\ndownload\r\ncontent_copy\r\nexpand_less\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n  <head>\r\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" \/>\r\n    <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image\/svg+xml\" href=\"\/vite.svg\" \/>\r\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" \/>\r\n    \r\n    <!-- PWA-specific head tags -->\r\n    <meta name=\"theme-color\" content=\"#ffffff\" \/>\r\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Scholar Agent - An AI-Powered Research Assistant\" \/>\r\n    <link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"\/icons\/apple-touch-icon.png\" sizes=\"180x180\">\r\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\" href=\"\/vite.svg\" color=\"#FFFFFF\">\r\n    <link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"\/manifest.json\" \/>\r\n\r\n    <title>Scholar Agent<\/title>\r\n  <\/head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <div id=\"root\"><\/div>\r\n    <script type=\"module\" src=\"\/src\/main.tsx\"><\/script>\r\n  <\/body>\r\n<\/html>\r\nStep 2: Create the Web App Manifest\r\n\r\nThe manifest file provides the browser with information about your PWA.\r\n\r\nCreate the file: In your public directory, create a new file named manifest.json. Vite will automatically copy everything from the public folder to the root of your build output.\r\n\r\nAdd the content:\r\n\r\ncode\r\nJSON\r\ndownload\r\ncontent_copy\r\nexpand_less\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\r\n{\r\n  \"short_name\": \"Scholar Agent\",\r\n  \"name\": \"Scholar Agent - AI-Powered Research Assistant\",\r\n  \"icons\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"src\": \"\/icons\/icon-192x192.png\",\r\n      \"type\": \"image\/png\",\r\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"src\": \"\/icons\/icon-512x512.png\",\r\n      \"type\": \"image\/png\",\r\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"start_url\": \".\",\r\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\r\n  \"theme_color\": \"#4A90E2\",\r\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\",\r\n  \"description\": \"An intelligent agent for academic research and literature analysis.\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nAdd Icons: Inside your public directory, create an icons folder. Add the necessary icon files (e.g., icon-192x192.png, icon-512x512.png, and apple-touch-icon.png).\r\n\r\nStep 3: Set Up the Service Worker (The Modern Vite Way)\r\n\r\nManually managing a service worker is complex and error-prone. The best practice in a Vite project is to use the vite-plugin-pwa plugin, which automates the entire process for you.\r\n\r\nInstall the plugin:\r\n\r\ncode\r\nBash\r\ndownload\r\ncontent_copy\r\nexpand_less\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\r\nnpm install vite-plugin-pwa -D\r\n\r\nConfigure vite.config.ts: Update your Vite configuration file to use the plugin. It will automatically generate a service worker and the manifest for you based on your configuration.\r\n\r\ncode\r\nTs\r\ndownload\r\ncontent_copy\r\nexpand_less\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\r\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\r\nimport react from '@vitejs\/plugin-react'\r\nimport { VitePWA } from 'vite-plugin-pwa'\r\n\r\n\/\/ https:\/\/vitejs.dev\/config\/\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    react(),\r\n    VitePWA({ \r\n      registerType: 'autoUpdate',\r\n      \/\/ You can still provide your own manifest.json in the public directory\r\n      \/\/ or configure it here. The plugin will merge them.\r\n      manifest: {\r\n        name: 'Scholar Agent - AI-Powered Research Assistant',\r\n        short_name: 'ScholarAgent',\r\n        description: 'An intelligent agent for academic research and literature analysis.',\r\n        theme_color: '#ffffff',\r\n        icons: [\r\n          {\r\n            src: 'icons\/icon-192x192.png',\r\n            sizes: '192x192',\r\n            type: 'image\/png'\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            src: 'icons\/icon-512x512.png',\r\n            sizes: '512x512',\r\n            type: 'image\/png'\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      \/\/ Workbox configuration for caching strategies\r\n      workbox: {\r\n        globPatterns: ['**\/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg}']\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n  ],\r\n})\r\n\r\nWhat this does:\r\n\r\nregisterType: 'autoUpdate': The service worker will update automatically without prompting the user.\r\n\r\nmanifest: { ... }: Configures your web app manifest directly. The plugin will generate manifest.json for you.\r\n\r\nworkbox: { ... }: Uses Workbox (a library from Google) to create a highly optimized service worker that pre-caches all your static assets, making your app available offline instantly.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Implement a Custom Install Prompt Component\r\n\r\nThis component will show an \"Install App\" button on supported browsers.\r\n\r\nDefine TypeScript types: The beforeinstallprompt event is not part of the standard DOM types, so we need to define it ourselves. Create a file named src\/vite-env.d.ts or add to your existing one:\r\n\r\ncode\r\nTs\r\ndownload\r\ncontent_copy\r\nexpand_less\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\r\n\/\/\/ <reference types=\"vite\/client\" \/>\r\n\r\ninterface BeforeInstallPromptEvent extends Event {\r\n  readonly platforms: Array<string>;\r\n  readonly userChoice: Promise<{\r\n    outcome: 'accepted' | 'dismissed',\r\n    platform: string,\r\n  }>;\r\n  prompt(): Promise<void>;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface WindowEventMap {\r\n  \"beforeinstallprompt\": BeforeInstallPromptEvent;\r\n}\r\n\r\nCreate the InstallPWA.tsx component: In your src\/components\/ directory, create this file.\r\n\r\ncode\r\nTsx\r\ndownload\r\ncontent_copy\r\nexpand_less\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\r\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\r\nimport { Button } from '@mui\/material';\r\nimport DownloadIcon from '@mui\/icons-material\/Download';\r\n\r\nconst InstallPWA = () => {\r\n  \/\/ Use the custom interface for type safety\r\n  const [prompt, setPrompt] = useState<BeforeInstallPromptEvent | null>(null);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const handleBeforeInstallPrompt = (e: BeforeInstallPromptEvent) => {\r\n      \/\/ Prevent the mini-infobar from appearing on mobile\r\n      e.preventDefault();\r\n      \/\/ Stash the event so it can be triggered later.\r\n      setPrompt(e);\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', handleBeforeInstallPrompt);\r\n\r\n    \/\/ Cleanup the event listener\r\n    return () => {\r\n      window.removeEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', handleBeforeInstallPrompt);\r\n    };\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  const handleInstallClick = async () => {\r\n    if (!prompt) {\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n    \/\/ Show the install prompt\r\n    await prompt.prompt();\r\n    \/\/ Wait for the user to respond to the prompt\r\n    const { outcome } = await prompt.userChoice;\r\n    console.log(`User response to the install prompt: ${outcome}`);\r\n    \/\/ We've used the prompt, and can't use it again, clear it\r\n    setPrompt(null);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  \/\/ Only show the button if the prompt is available\r\n  if (!prompt) {\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <Button\r\n      variant=\"contained\"\r\n      color=\"primary\"\r\n      onClick={handleInstallClick}\r\n      startIcon={<DownloadIcon \/>}\r\n      sx={{ fontWeight: 600 }}\r\n    >\r\n      Install App\r\n    <\/Button>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default InstallPWA;\r\n\r\nUse the component: Add the InstallPWA button to your UI, for example, in the header of your main App.tsx file.\r\n\r\ncode\r\nTsx\r\ndownload\r\ncontent_copy\r\nexpand_less\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START\r\nIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\nimport InstallPWA from '.\/components\/InstallPWA'; \/\/ Adjust path if needed\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <header style={{ padding: '1rem', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', alignItems: 'center' }}>\r\n        <h1>Scholar Agent<\/h1>\r\n        <InstallPWA \/>\r\n      <\/header>\r\n      {\/* The rest of your app's routing and content *\/}\r\n    <\/div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\nStep 5: Build and Test Your PWA\r\n\r\nBuild for Production:\r\nnpm run build\r\n\r\nPreview the Production Build: Vite has a built-in server to test the production output.\r\nnpm run preview\r\n\r\nTest in the Browser:\r\n\r\nOpen the preview URL in your browser.\r\n\r\nOpen DevTools (F12), go to the Application tab.\r\n\r\nCheck the Manifest section to ensure it's loaded.\r\n\r\nCheck the Service Workers section to confirm the service worker is activated and running.\r\n\r\nYou should see your custom \"Install App\" button.

      "aiResponse": "Of course, here is the system design document for the Scholar Agent platform.\r\n\r\nSystem Design Document: Scholar Agent\r\n1. Introduction\r\n\r\nScholar Agent is an AI-powered platform designed to automate and accelerate the academic literature review process. For students, academics, and researchers, conducting a thorough literature review is a foundational yet incredibly time-consuming task, often taking weeks or even months. The process involves identifying relevant papers, meticulously reading and analyzing each one, and synthesizing the findings to identify trends, contributions, and, most importantly, research gaps.\r\n\r\nScholar Agent addresses this challenge by employing a multi-agent AI system that can reason, plan, and execute the entire literature review workflow. Users simply provide a research topic and question, and the Scholar Agent handles the rest\u2014from discovering relevant academic papers to delivering a fully synthesized report, complete with identified research gaps, directly to the user's inbox. This not only saves hundreds of hours of manual effort but also empowers researchers to focus on innovation and discovery.\r\n\r\n2. System Architecture\r\n\r\nThe Scholar Agent platform is built on a modern, decoupled client-server architecture, supported by a robust background processing system to handle long-running, asynchronous AI tasks. This design ensures scalability, maintainability, and a responsive user experience.\r\n\r\nThe architecture consists of five primary layers:\r\n\r\nFrontend (Client): A Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React and Vite, responsible for all user interactions. It is deployed globally on Vercel's edge network.\r\n\r\nBackend (Server): A RESTful API server built with Python and FastAPI. This layer handles user authentication, project management, and orchestrates the AI agents. It is deployed as a Web Service on Render.\r\n\r\nBackground Processing: A task queue system using Celery and Redis. This is the core of the AI workflow, executing the multi-agent processes asynchronously. It runs as a Background Worker on Render.\r\n\r\nData Persistence: A PostgreSQL database for storing all application data, including user profiles, research projects, and analyzed papers. It is managed as a private service on Render.\r\n\r\nExternal Services: A suite of third-party APIs that provide the intelligence and data for the platform, including Google Gemini, arXiv, Semantic Scholar, and Brevo for email delivery.\r\n\r\nArchitectural Diagram\r\ncode\r\nCode\r\ndownload\r\ncontent_copy\r\nexpand_less\r\n\r\n+------------------+      +------------------+      +---------------------+\r\n|   User Browser   |----->|  Vercel (React)  |<---->|   Render (FastAPI)  |\r\n|      (PWA)       |      |    Frontend      |      |     Backend API     |\r\n+------------------+      +------------------+      +----------+----------+\r\n                                                               |\r\n                                                               v\r\n                                                      +-----------------+\r\n                                                      | Render (Redis)  |\r\n                                                      |   Task Broker   |\r\n                                                      +--------+--------+\r\n                                                               | (Queues Tasks)\r\n                                                               v\r\n+----------------------+      +------------------------+      +----------------------+\r\n|  Google Gemini API   |<-----| Render (Celery Worker) |----->|  PostgreSQL DB       |\r\n+----------------------+      |   Background Agent     |      | (Render)             |\r\n| arXiv \/ Sem.

Data Design\r\n\r\nThe data model is designed relationally to ensure data integrity, consistency, and efficient querying. We chose PostgreSQL as our database, deployed on Render.\r\n\r\nWhy PostgreSQL?\r\n\r\nReliability & ACID Compliance: Guarantees that transactions are processed reliably, which is critical for managing user data and project states.\r\n\r\nScalability: It can handle a high volume of simultaneous connections and write operations, which is essential as the user base grows and more research projects are processed concurrently.\r\n\r\nRich Feature Set: Excellent support for JSON data types, allowing us to store semi-structured data like agent plan steps and keywords flexibly within a relational structure.\r\n\r\nManaged Service: Using Render's managed PostgreSQL simplifies database administration, backups, and scaling.\r\n\r\nDatabase Schema\r\n\r\nThe schema is centered around four main models: User, ResearchProject, PaperReference, and AgentPlan.\r\n\r\nUser: Stores user authentication and profile information.\r\n\r\nid (PK, String\/UUID)\r\n\r\nemail (String, Unique)\r\n\r\nname (String)\r\n\r\nhashed_password (String)\r\n\r\nResearchProject: Represents a single literature review task initiated by a user.\r\n\r\nid (PK, String\/UUID)\r\n\r\nuser_id (FK to User)\r\n\r\ntitle (String)\r\n\r\nresearch_question (Text)\r\n\r\nkeywords (JSON): A list of search terms generated by the Planner Agent.\r\n\r\nsubtopics (JSON): A list of subtopics for structuring the review.\r\n\r\nstatus (String): Tracks the project's current state (e.g., created, searching, analyzing, completed, error).\r\n\r\ntotal_papers_found (Integer): The number of papers discovered, used for progress tracking on the frontend.\r\n\r\nPaperReference: Stores metadata for each academic paper discovered and analyzed for a project.\r\n\r\nid (PK, String\/UUID)\r\n\r\nproject_id (FK to ResearchProject)\r\n\r\ntitle (String)\r\n\r\nauthors (JSON)\r\n\r\nabstract (Text)\r\n\r\nurl (String): Direct link to the paper source.\r\n\r\nrelevance_score (Float): A score from 0-100 generated by the Analyzer Agent.\r\n\r\nAgentPlan: A log of the steps and outputs generated by each agent for a given project.\r\n\r\nid (PK, String\/UUID)\r\n\r\nproject_id (FK to ResearchProject)\r\n\r\nagent_type (String): The agent responsible (e.g., analyzer, synthesizer).\r\n\r\nplan_steps (JSON): Detailed log of agent actions and their results.\r\n\r\n4. Component Breakdown\r\nFrontend (Client-Side)\r\n\r\nThe frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript, bootstrapped with Vite.\r\n\r\nUI Framework: A hybrid approach using Material-UI (MUI) for its robust component library and Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling and customization. This combination delivers a clean, modern, and responsive UI\/UX.\r\n\r\nState Management: Zustand is used for simple, boilerplate-free global state management, primarily for handling user authentication (authStore) and the list of research projects (projectStore).\r\n\r\nData Fetching & Caching: TanStack React Query manages all server-state. It simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization, providing a better user experience by reducing loading times and handling background updates.\r\n\r\nAPI Communication: An Axios client is configured to communicate with the backend REST API, with interceptors to automatically attach the JWT authentication token to requests.\r\n\r\nProgressive Web App (PWA): The vite-plugin-pwa is used to make the application installable on desktop and mobile devices, providing an app-like experience and enabling future offline capabilities.\r\n\r\nBackend (Server-Side)\r\n\r\nThe backend is a high-performance REST API built with Python and the FastAPI framework.\r\n\r\nAPI Style (REST): REST was chosen for its simplicity, statelessness, and broad compatibility. It provides a clear and conventional way for the frontend to interact with the server.\r\n\r\nAuthentication: User authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The backend provides \/register and \/token endpoints. Protected routes require a valid Bearer token, which is decoded and verified on each request.\r\n\r\nORM: SQLAlchemy is used as the Object-Relational Mapper, providing a robust and pythonic way to interact with the PostgreSQL database.\r\n\r\nAsynchronous Task Processing: This is the most critical component of the backend architecture.\r\n\r\nCelery: A powerful distributed task queue used to run the long-running literature review process in the background. When a user starts a review, the API creates a task and places it on the queue, immediately returning a response to the user.\r\n\r\nRedis: Acts as the message broker for Celery, holding the queue of tasks to be executed by the Celery workers. It also serves as the result backend.\r\n\r\nMulti-Agent Collaboration: The core logic is structured as a pipeline of collaborating agents:\r\n\r\nPlanner Agent: Triggered first. It uses the Google Gemini API to analyze the user's research question and generate a strategic plan, consisting of precise keywords and subtopics.\r\n\r\nPaper Retriever: A utility component that takes the keywords and queries external academic APIs (arXiv and Semantic Scholar) to find relevant papers.\r\n\r\nAnalyzer Agent: This agent runs in a loop for each paper found. It uses the Gemini API to \"read\" the paper's abstract, extract key findings, methodologies, and limitations, and assign a relevance score.\r\n\r\nSynthesizer Agent: The final agent in the pipeline. It takes the structured analyses from all papers and uses the Gemini API to weave them into a coherent literature review, highlighting themes and identifying research gaps.\r\n\r\nEmail Integration: Upon successful completion of the Synthesizer agent's task, the backend uses the Brevo API to send the final report directly to the user's registered email address.\r\n\r\nContainerization: Docker was used for local development to create a consistent and reproducible environment, ensuring that all services (API, database, Redis) work together seamlessly. This container-first approach aligns perfectly with deployment on modern cloud platforms like Render.\r\n\r\n5. Chosen Technologies & Reasoning\r\nCategory\tTechnology\tReason for Choice\r\nFrontend\tReact, TypeScript, Vite\tIndustry-standard for building modern, fast, and maintainable user interfaces. Vite provides a superior development experience.\r\n\tZustand, React Query\tLightweight yet powerful state management and server-state synchronization, reducing boilerplate and improving performance.\r\n\tDeployment: Vercel\tBest-in-class platform for hosting frontend applications, offering a global CDN, seamless CI\/CD from GitHub, and zero-configuration deployments.\r\nBackend\tPython, FastAPI\tPython's rich ecosystem for AI\/ML is essential. FastAPI provides extremely high performance (on par with NodeJS\/Go), automatic API docs, and modern asynchronous capabilities.\r\n\tCelery, Redis\tThe go-to solution in the Python world for reliable, scalable background task processing. Crucial for handling long-running AI jobs without blocking the API or the user.\r\n\tPostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy\tA robust, production-grade relational database paired with a powerful ORM for data integrity and maintainability.\r\n\tDeployment: Render\tA unified cloud platform that simplifies deploying all backend components (web service, worker, database, Redis) with private networking, auto-scaling, and Git-based deploys.\r\nAI & Data\tGoogle Gemini API\tA powerful, state-of-the-art Large Language Model that provides the core reasoning capabilities for all the AI agents at a competitive cost.\r\n\tarXiv & Semantic Scholar APIs\tProvide free, programmatic access to millions of academic papers, forming the essential knowledge base for the literature search.\r\nCommunication\tBrevo (formerly Sendinblue)\tA reliable and developer-friendly transactional email API for delivering the final synthesized reports to users, a key feature of the platform.\r\n6. Originality & Social Impact\r\n\r\nOriginality: Scholar Agent's novelty lies in its practical application of a multi-agent AI architecture to a specific, high-value academic workflow. While general-purpose AI assistants exist, this platform is purpose-built for the literature review process. It doesn't just find papers; it reads, analyzes, and synthesizes them to generate new insights, specifically focusing on the critical task of identifying research gaps. The seamless integration of planning, analysis, and synthesis into a single, automated pipeline is a unique and powerful offering. The user interface, which provides real-time status updates on the agent's progress, further enhances the user experience and transparency of the AI's work.\r\n\r\nSocial Impact: The platform has the potential to significantly impact the academic and research communities:\r\n\r\nAccelerating Scientific Discovery: By reducing the time for a literature review from months to minutes, researchers can move faster from ideation to experimentation, accelerating the overall pace of innovation.\r\n\r\nDemocratizing Research: It provides a powerful tool that was previously unavailable to under-resourced institutions or independent researchers, leveling the playing field.\r\n\r\nEducational Tool: It can serve as an educational aid for graduate students, helping them understand the structure of a good literature review and quickly get up to speed on a new field of study.\r\n\r\nCombating Information Overload: In an era where thousands of papers are published daily, Scholar Agent provides a crucial tool to navigate this flood of information and pinpoint the most relevant and impactful studies."
